Welcome to Tessera Educational Platform - a comprehensive cybersecurity and systems analysis learning environment designed for university students and professionals.

## 🏗️ Platform Architecture

### **Student Learning Site (GitHub Pages)**
- **URL:** https://tessera.locoensayo.org
- **Purpose:** Educational content, interactive chatbots, documentation
- **Technology:** Quarto static site generator
- **Features:** Unit-based access control, time-release content, educational scenarios

### **Unit Coordinator Admin Site (Vercel)**
- **URL:** https://cloudcore-uc.vercel.app/
- **Purpose:** Content management and access control for educators
- **Technology:** HTML/JS with Vercel serverless functions
- **Features:** Password management, access control, content editing

## 🎓 Educational Focus

Tessera simulates a fictional cloud services company experiencing a security incident, providing realistic learning scenarios for:

- **Information Security Audit and Control (ISYS6018)**
- **Systems Analysis and Design (ISYS2002)**
- **Knowledge Management and Intelligent Systems (ISYS6014)**
- **Information Systems Analysis and Design (ISAD5001)**

## 🔧 For Developers

### Prerequisites
- Git
- [Quarto CLI](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
- Node.js (for admin interface development)

### Local Development
```bash
git clone https://github.com/michael-borck/cloudcore.git
cd cloudcore

# Run student site locally
quarto preview

# Run admin interface locally (from tessera-admin folder)
cd tessera-admin
npm install
vercel dev
```

## 🎛️ For Unit Coordinators

1. **Access the admin interface:** https://cloudcore-uc.vercel.app/
2. **Login with your unit credentials** (provided by site administrator)
3. **Manage student access:** Set passwords, configure access rules
4. **Upload content:** Add new scenarios, documents, and resources
5. **Monitor usage:** View activity and student progress

## 🏫 For Students

1. **Visit the learning site:** https://tessera.locoensayo.org
2. **Enter your unit password** (provided by your Unit Coordinator)
3. **Explore scenarios:** Access time-released content based on your unit
4. **Interact with staff:** Chat with AI-powered Tessera employees
5. **Review documents:** Access policies, logs, and incident reports

## 🔐 Access Control System

The platform uses a sophisticated unit-based access control system:
- **Time-based release:** Content unlocks at specific dates
- **Scenario-based access:** Unit-specific content filtering
- **Password protection:** Unit Coordinators set custom passwords
- **Role simulation:** Students experience consultant/auditor perspectives
