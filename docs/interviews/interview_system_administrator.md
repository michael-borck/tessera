Auditor: Thanks for taking the time to speak with me today. I'd like to discuss
the controls you have in place for managing system security configurations.
Could you walk me through your configuration hardening standards?

SysAdmin: Sure, we utilise industry standard benchmarks like CIS and NIST to
lock down settings for OS, firewalls, databases and more according to best
practices. We keep gold images to simplify patching and deployment.

Auditor: Excellent. And how do you ensure consistency and compliance with those
standards?

SysAdmin: Our configuration management system scans new systems against the gold
benchmark to validate before production. We also run monthly audits to identify
any drift or issues.

Auditor: Great to hear. I'm here to understand how your systems are secured in
an open discussion. If any gaps arise, I'll work with you on practical
recommendations. Does that sound agreeable?

SysAdmin: Absolutely, I look forward to the constructive feedback on where we
can improve. We take a continuous learning approach to security and compliance
here.

Auditor: Glad we're on the same page. Could you tell me about how you perform
patch management and keep systems up-to-date?

SysAdmin: Of course. We classify patches by criticality. Critical and security
updates are applied on a 2 week cycle to production after testing...

Auditor: What tools and capabilities do you utilise for monitoring and logging
system activity?

SysAdmin: We deploy Sysmon for endpoint logging and have a SIEM collecting logs
centrally. Critical systems utilise process monitoring to detect malicious
changes.

Auditor: Could you outline the key controls you have in place to secure
privileged access to systems?

SysAdmin: Minimising standing privilege access, enforcing MFA for admin
accounts, using privilged access management tools for just-in-time elevation.
Logs are closely monitored.

Auditor: What is your approach to infrastructure automation and configuration
management?

SysAdmin: We utilise Ansible and Terraform to automate deployment,
configuration, and management based on code. This reduces human errors and
enforces standards.

Auditor: How do you control and track system-level changes to ensure they are
authorised and audited?

SysAdmin: Change requests are documented and approved in our ticketing system.
Changes made are logged and compared to tickets for audit purposes.

Auditor: Finally, how do you ensure disaster recovery capabilities for critical
systems?

SysAdmin: Documented recovery plans, regular backups to secondary sites. Annual
DR tests validate ability to meet RTO/RPO with failover. Gaps are addressed in
remediation plans.

Auditor: Do you have any difficulties implementing security guidance from
infosec teams?

SysAdmin: Generally no, we view security collaboration as necessary and
beneficial. There can be tension around legacy systems where controls introduce
availability/performance risks. But with consultation we determine workarounds.

Auditor: How are priority conflicts between operations and security handled?

SysAdmin: Health and availability needs take precedence where reasonable. We
perform risk analysis jointly and identify solutions together - perhaps delaying
patches, implementing compensating controls or accepting risks with approval.

Auditor: Are there any gaps in training or knowledge transfer between sysadmin
and infosec teams?

SysAdmin: Knowledge sharing occurs informally via meetings and tickets. More
formalised cross-training could be beneficial though to expand skills. Shadowing
and job rotations could help strengthen the partnership and understanding
between our teams.
