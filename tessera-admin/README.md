# Tessera Lecturer Dashboard

Web-based dashboard for lecturers to manage their unit's content and access settings. Connects to cloudcore-api for backend operations.

## Setup

The dashboard requires cloudcore-api to be running. Configure the API URL in `cloudcore-api.js`:

```javascript
baseUrl: window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
    ? 'http://localhost:8001'
    : 'https://cloudcore-api.eduserver.au',
```

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `index.html` | Landing page with login link |
| `login.html` | Authentication (email/password) |
| `dashboard.html` | Main management interface |
| `dashboard.js` | Dashboard logic |
| `cloudcore-api.js` | API client library |

## Features
