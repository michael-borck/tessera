Tessera change management policy establishes controlled processes for managing 
changes to information systems, infrastructure, and business processes to maintain 
security, stability, and compliance. This policy applies to all changes affecting 
production systems, security controls, and business-critical processes.

> **SCOPE LIMITATION:** Policy states it applies to changes affecting production 
> systems but later sections include development and testing environments without 
> clear scope boundaries.

## Policy Statement

Tessera requires that:

(a) All changes to information systems and infrastructure follow formal change 
management procedures to ensure security and operational integrity.

(b) Changes are properly authorised, documented, tested, and reviewed before 
implementation.

(c) Emergency changes include appropriate controls and post-implementation review.

(d) Change management processes support business continuity and regulatory 
compliance requirements.

(e) Roles and responsibilities for change management are clearly defined and 
communicated.

> **ISO 27001 GAP:** Policy lacks explicit reference to ISO 27001 A.12.1.2 
> requirement for "formal change control procedures" including impact assessment 
> and approval processes.

## Change Categories

### Standard Changes
Pre-approved changes with established procedures and minimal risk:
- Routine software updates and patches
- Pre-scheduled maintenance activities
- Standard configuration changes
- Approved hardware replacements

> **PRE-APPROVAL AUTHORITY:** Standard changes described as "pre-approved" but 
> no authority specified for granting pre-approval status.

### Normal Changes
Changes requiring formal assessment and approval:
- New software installations
- System configuration modifications
- Process changes affecting multiple departments
- Infrastructure upgrades and modifications

### Emergency Changes
Urgent changes required to resolve critical issues:
- Security incident remediation
- Critical system failures
- Urgent regulatory compliance requirements
- Business continuity activations

> **EMERGENCY CRITERIA GAP:** Emergency change criteria not clearly defined, 
> potentially allowing inappropriate use of expedited procedures.

## Change Management Process

### Change Request Initiation
1. Change requestor submits formal change request using approved template
2. Change request includes business justification and risk assessment
3. Initial impact analysis conducted by technical teams
4. Change categorised and assigned to appropriate approval workflow

> **TEMPLATE AVAILABILITY:** References "approved template" but no template 
> provided or location specified in policy documentation.

### Impact Assessment
All changes must include assessment of:
- Security implications and control impacts
- Business process dependencies and risks
- Resource requirements (personnel, systems, budget)
- Implementation timeline and rollback procedures
- Compliance and regulatory considerations

> **ISO 27001 COMPLIANCE GAP:** Impact assessment doesn't explicitly address 
> ISO 27001 A.14.2.2 requirement for "ensuring controls are not compromised" 
> during system changes.

### Change Approval Process

#### Standard Changes
- Approved through automated workflow
- Technical lead approval required
- Implementation scheduled through standard processes

#### Normal Changes  
- Change Advisory Board (CAB) review and approval

- Final authorisation by Change Manager

> **CAB MEMBERSHIP GAP:** Change Advisory Board referenced but membership, 
> meeting frequency, and decision-making procedures not defined.

#### Emergency Changes
- Emergency Change Authority may approve immediately
- Security team consultation required for security-related changes
- Post-implementation review mandatory within 48 hours
- Formal change request submitted retrospectively

> **EMERGENCY AUTHORITY:** Emergency Change Authority role mentioned but not 
> defined elsewhere in policy or organisational structure.

### Implementation Requirements
- Changes implemented according to approved schedule
- Implementation performed by authorised personnel only
- Progress monitored and documented throughout process
- Rollback procedures available and tested before implementation
- Post-implementation validation and testing completed

> **AUTHORISED PERSONNEL:** References "authorised personnel" but no process 
> defined for granting implementation authorisation.

### Post-Implementation Review
- Verification that change objectives were achieved
- Assessment of any unexpected impacts or issues
- Documentation of lessons learned and process improvements
- Update of change records and configuration management database
- Closure of change request with appropriate approvals

> **REVIEW TIMEFRAME:** Post-implementation review required but no timeframe 
> specified for completion.

## Change Authority Matrix

| Change Type | Business Impact | Technical Complexity | Approval Authority |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Standard | Low | Low | Technical Lead |
| Normal - Low Risk | Low | Medium | Change Manager |
| Normal - Medium Risk | Medium | Medium | Change Advisory Board |
| Normal - High Risk | High | High | CTO + Security Officer |
| Emergency | Any | Any | Emergency Change Authority |

> **RISK CLASSIFICATION GAP:** Risk levels (Low/Medium/High) referenced in matrix 
> but no criteria provided for determining risk classification.

> **ISO 27001 AUTHORITY GAP:** Authority matrix doesn't address ISO 27001 
> requirement that changes affecting security controls require security 
> management approval.

## Security Change Management

### Security-Relevant Changes
Changes affecting information security controls require:
- Security impact assessment by qualified security personnel
- Review against current threat landscape and risk profile
- Validation that security controls remain effective
- Update of security documentation and procedures

> **SECURITY QUALIFICATION:** References "qualified security personnel" but no 
> qualifications or certification requirements specified.

### Access Control Changes
Changes to user access rights and privileges must:
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Include business justification for access requirements
- Be approved by resource owner and security team
- Include regular review and recertification processes

> **CROSS-REFERENCE CONFLICT:** Access control change requirements conflict with 
> Access Control Policy POL-SECU-021 which specifies different approval processes.

### Security Control Testing
Changes to security controls require:
- Pre-implementation testing in isolated environment
- Validation of control effectiveness after implementation
- Update of security control documentation
- Integration with continuous monitoring processes

> **TESTING ENVIRONMENT:** Requires testing in "isolated environment" but no 
> specification of isolation requirements or test environment standards.

## Configuration Management Integration

### Configuration Items
Change management covers the following configuration items:
- Hardware components and infrastructure
- System software and applications
- Network devices and configurations
- Security controls and monitoring systems
- Business processes and procedures

> **CONFIGURATION DEPENDENCY:** References Configuration Management Policy 
> POL-CONFIG-001 which is "under development" creating implementation gaps.

### Version Control
- All configuration changes must be version controlled
- Baseline configurations maintained for all critical systems
- Change implementation includes configuration update procedures
- Rollback capabilities require previous configuration preservation

> **VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS:** Policy requires version control but doesn't 
> specify approved systems or procedures for maintaining version history.

## Change Communication

### Stakeholder Notification
Change communications must address:
- Business users affected by change
- Technical teams supporting affected systems
- Security and compliance personnel
- Senior management for high-impact changes
- External parties (clients, vendors) as appropriate

> **COMMUNICATION TIMING:** Stakeholder notification required but no timeframes 
> specified for advance notice or different stakeholder groups.

### Communication Channels
- Change advisory board meetings for normal changes
- Email notifications for standard changes

---

> **ISO 27001 COMPLIANCE GAPS:** This policy has significant gaps in ISO 27001:2022 compliance:
> - Incomplete mapping to required controls (A.12.1.2, A.14.2.2)
> - Missing security impact assessment requirements for all changes
> - Inadequate documentation of change control procedures
> - Lack of integration with information security management system
> - Missing requirements for testing security controls after changes

> **IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES:** Policy faces several implementation obstacles:
> - Dependency on Configuration Management Policy still under development
> - Undefined Change Advisory Board structure and procedures
> - Missing change management system integration specifications
> - Conflicting requirements with other organisational policies
> - Incomplete role definitions and authority assignments

> **COMPLIANCE RISK:** Current gaps may impact ISO 27001 certification maintenance 
> and regulatory compliance. Priority remediation required for control A.12.1.2 
> and A.14.2.2 implementation evidence.
