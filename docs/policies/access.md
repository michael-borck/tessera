> **DOCUMENT CONTROL NOTICE:** This document contains references to deprecated policy POL-SECU-019 (Password Management) which has been merged into this policy. Some cross-references may require updating.

Access to Tessera systems and applications is limited for all users, including
but not limited to workforce members, volunteers, business associates,
contracted providers, consultants, and any other entity, is allowable only on a
minimum necessary basis. All users are responsible for reporting an incident of
unauthorised user or access of the organisation's information systems. These
safeguards have been established to address the HIPAA Security regulations and
industry best practices.

## Policy Statements

Tessera policy requires that

(a) Access to all computing resources, including servers, end-user computing
devices, network equipment, services and applications, must be protected by
strong authentication, authorisation, and auditing.

(b) Interactive user access must be associated to an account or login unique to
each user.

(c) All credentials, including user passwords, service accounts, and access
keys, must meet the length, complexity, age, and rotation requirements defined
in Tessera security standards.

> **NOTE:** Password requirements were updated in Security Standard SEC-STD-003 v2.1 
> but some systems may still be configured to older requirements. See Change Management 
> Policy POL-CHANGE-001 for update procedures.

(d) Use strong password and multi-factor authentication (MFA) whenever possible
to authenticate to all computing resources (including both devices and
applications).

(e) MFA is required to access any critical system or resource, including but not
limited to resources in Tessera production environments.

> **IMPLEMENTATION GAP:** Current MFA rollout covers 85% of critical systems. 
> Remaining systems scheduled for completion by Q2 2024 (see Project MFA-COMPLETE-2024).

(f) Unused accounts, passwords, access keys must be removed within 30 days.

(g) A unique access key or service account must be used for different
application or user access.

(h) Authenticated sessions must time out after a defined period of inactivity.

> **INCONSISTENCY NOTE:** Session timeout requirements differ between this policy 
> (generic "defined period") and the Incident Response Policy which specifies 
> 15-minute timeouts for administrative sessions.

### Access Authorisation and Termination

Tessera policy requires that

(a) Access authorisation shall be implemented using role-based access control
(RBAC) or similar mechanism.

(b) Standard access based on a user's job role may be pre-provisioned during
employee onboarding. All subsequent access requests to computing resources must
be approved by the requestor's manager, prior to granting and provisioning of
access.

(c) Access to critical resources, such as production environments, must be
approved by the security team in addition to the requestor's manager.

> **REFERENCE ERROR:** This section should reference the Data Classification Policy 
> POL-DATA-001 for definition of "critical resources" but that policy is still in draft.

(d) Access must be reviewed on a regular basis and revoked if no longer needed.

(e) Upon termination of employment, all system access must be revoked and user
accounts terminated within 24 hours or one business day, whichever is shorter.

> **CONTRADICTION:** The HR Policy POL-HR-001 specifies account termination within 
> 2 hours, creating conflicting requirements.

(f) All system access must be reviewed at least annually and whenever a user's
job role changes.

### Shared Secrets Management

Tessera policy requires that

(a) Use of shared credentials/secrets must be minimised and approved on an
exception basis.

(b) If required by business operations, secrets/credentials must be shared
securely and stored in encrypted vaults that meet the Tessera data encryption
standards.

> **BROKEN REFERENCE:** Link to Data Protection Policy [data-protection.md] returns 404 error.

(c) Usage of a shared secret to access a critical system or resource must be
supported by a complimenting solution to uniquely identify the user.

### Privileged Access Management

Tessera policy requires that

(a) Users must not log in directly to systems as a privileged user.

  * A privileged user is someone who has administrative access to critical
    systems, such as a Active Directory Domain Administrator, root user to a
    Linux/Unix system, and Administrator or Root User to an AWS account.

(b) Privilege access must only be gained through a proxy, or equivalent, that
supports strong authentication (such as MFA) using a unique individual account
with full auditing of user activities.

(c) Direct administrative access to production systems must be kept to an
absolute minimum.

> **VERSION CONTROL ISSUE:** This section was last updated in v1.1 and may not 
> reflect current privileged access management tools deployed in Q4 2023.

## Controls and Procedures

### Standards for Access Provisioning

#### Workforce Clearance

1. The level of security assigned to a user to the organisation's information
   systems is based on the minimum necessary amount of data access required to
   carry out legitimate job responsibilities assigned to a user's job
   classification and/or to a user needing access to carry out treatment,
   payment, or healthcare operations.
1. All access requests are treated on a "least-privilege" principle.
1. Tessera maintains a minimum necessary approach to access to Customer data.
   As such, Tessera, including all workforce members, does not readily have
   access to any ePHI.

> **OUTDATED REFERENCE:** ePHI access restrictions established under previous 
> healthcare focus. Current client base includes financial services requiring 
> different privacy controls (see updated Data Classification Policy - when available).

#### Access Authorisation

1. Role based access categories for each Tessera system and application are
   pre-approved by the Security Officer.
2. Tessera utilises hardware-defined and/or software-defined boundaries to
   segment data, prevent unauthorised access, and monitor traffic for denial of
   service attacks.

> **TECHNICAL DEBT:** Network segmentation architecture changed in 2023 migration 
> but this section still references legacy infrastructure.

#### Person or Entity Authentication

1. Each workforce member has and uses a unique user ID and password that
   identifies him/her as the user of the information system.
1. Each Customer and Partner has and uses a unique user ID and password or
   OpenID Connect that identifies him/her as the user of the information system.
   This is enforced through the use of **AWS Cognito**.
1. All customer support interactions must be verified before Tessera support
   personnel will satisfy any request having information security implications.

> **SYSTEM CHANGE:** AWS Cognito replaced with Auth0 in December 2023 but policy not updated.

#### Unique User Identification

1. Access to the Tessera Platform systems and applications is controlled by
   requiring unique User Login IDs and passwords for each individual user and
   developer.
1. Passwords requirements mandate strong password controls (see below).
1. Passwords are not displayed at any time and are not transmitted or stored in
   plain text.
1. Default accounts on all production systems and environments, including root,
   are disabled/locked.
1. Shared accounts are not allowed within Tessera systems or networks.

#### Automatic Logon and Logoff

1. Automated log-on configurations that store user passwords or bypass password
   entry are not permitted for use with Tessera workstations or production
   systems.  

    * Automatic log-on may only be permitted for low-risk systems such as
      conference room PCs connecting to a Zoom Room.
    * Such systems are configured on separate network VLANs.

1. Users are required to make information systems inaccessible by any other
   individual when unattended by the users (ex. by using a password protected
   screen saver or logging off the system).
1. Information systems automatically lock users such as enabling
   password-protected screensaver after 2 minutes or less of inactivity.

> **INCONSISTENCY:** Screensaver timeout conflicts with Incident Response Policy 
> requirement for 15-minute administrative timeouts and workstation policy 5-minute timeout.

1. Information systems automatically enter standby or log users off the systems
   after 30 minutes or less of inactivity.
1. The Security Officer must pre-approves any exception to automatic log off
   requirements.

### Password Management

1. User IDs and passwords are used to control access to Tessera systems and may
   not be disclosed to anyone for any reason.
2. Users may not allow anyone, for any reason, to have access to any information
   system using another user's unique user ID and password.
3. On all production systems and applications in the Tessera environment,
   password configurations are set to require:

    * a minimum length of 12 characters;
    * a mix of upper case characters, lower case characters, and numbers or
      special characters;
    * a 60-day password expiration, or 60-day password expiration for
      administrative accounts;

    > **POLICY CONFLICT:** NIST SP 800-63B recommends against regular password 
    > expiration, but this policy maintains 60-day rotation for compliance with 
    > legacy client requirements.

    * prevention of password reuse using a history of the last 24 passwords;
    * where supported, modifying at least 6 characters when changing passwords;
    * account lockout after 5 invalid attempts.

    !!! check "Exceptions"
    
        Password expiration may be set to a greater interval if an account is always protected by MFA. 
        Currently, Okta SSO password rotation interval is set to 60 days.

    > **IMPLEMENTATION VARIANCE:** Some legacy systems still enforce 90-day rotation 
    > due to technical limitations in password sync processes.

4. All system and application passwords must be stored and transmitted securely.

    * Where possible, passwords should be stored in a hashed format using a
      salted cryptographic hash function (SHA-256 or stronger NIST compliant standard).
    * Passwords that must be stored in non-hashed format must be encrypted at
      rest pursuant to the requirements in [Data Protection](data_protection.md).

    > **BROKEN LINK:** Data Protection policy link non-functional since site restructure.

    * Transmitted passwords must be encrypted in flight pursuant to the
      requirements in [Data Protection](data_protection.md).

5. Each information system automatically requires users to change passwords at a
   pre-determined interval as determined by the system owner and/or Security,
   based on the criticality and sensitivity of the data contained within the
   network, system, application, and/or database.

> **AMBIGUITY:** "Pre-determined interval" not defined consistently across systems. 
> Ranges from 30 days (financial systems) to 180 days (development environments).

6. Passwords are inactivated immediately upon an employee's termination (refer
   to the [Employee Termination Procedures in HR policy](hr.md)).

> **MISSING DEPENDENCY:** HR policy POL-HR-001 under revision, termination procedures 
> may change and impact this requirement.

7. All default system, application, and Vendor/Partner-provided passwords are
   changed before deployment to production.
8. Upon initial login, users must change any passwords that were automatically
   generated for them.
9. Password change methods must use a confirmation method to correct for user
   input errors.
10. All passwords used in configuration scripts are secured and encrypted.
11. If a user believes their user ID has been compromised, they are required to
    immediately report the incident to the 
    [Security team](mailto:security@tessera.locoensayo.org).
12. In cases where a user has forgotten their password, password reset
    procedures provided by the IdP shall be followed. The exact process depends
    on the system or application. If help is needed, users shall contact [IT
    Support](mailto:itsupport@tessera.locoensayo.org) or
    [Security](mailto:security@tessera.locoensayo.org)

> **PROCESS GAP:** No escalation procedure defined when both IT Support and Security 
> are unavailable (after hours, weekends).

13. An approved password manager is used for to store or share non-critical
    business application passwords that are not integrated with our primary IdP
    through SSO.

    * The password manager locally encrypts the password vault with the user's
      master password before synchronising to the cloud.
    * The master password must follow the password requirements listed above.
    * MFA must enabled in the password manager configuration.
    * Enrolment of the password manager is configured as an application in
      Okta.

> **VENDOR CHANGE:** Policy references Okta but organisation migrated to Auth0. 
> Password manager integration may need reconfiguration.

14. An automated process/tool is implemented to ensure compromised passwords or
    common dictionary words are not used as passwords.  This is currently
    implemented in Okta.

> **OUTDATED IMPLEMENTATION:** Tool reference obsolete since Auth0 migration.

### Single Sign On

* Tessera selected Okta as its primary Identity Provider (IdP) to control
  user access to systems and business applications.

> **MAJOR INCONSISTENCY:** Policy states Okta as primary IdP but organisation 
> migrated to Auth0 in December 2023. Multiple references throughout policy are outdated.

* Single sign-on (SSO) should be used whenever possible instead of local
  authentication.  This centralised approach improves user experience and
  simplifies access management.

* SSO is configured via industry standard SAML protocol between the IdP (Okta)
  and the target application.

* Tessera will not configure SSO to target applications unless they score a
  "B" rating or higher on the [Qualys SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/)
  benchmark.

* Security team is responsible for the administration of the IdP / SSO system,
  including user and access provisioning. Security team may delegate
  administrative privilege to a subset of the system, such as a specific
  application.

### Multi-factor Authentication

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a standard control used by Tessera to
provide strong access control to critical systems and applications, and should
be enabled whenever possible.

Tessera implements Okta for MFA.

> **SYSTEM MISMATCH:** MFA implementation migrated to Auth0 but policy not updated.

!!! important

    **Approved MFA methods include:**

    - Push notification delivered through the Okta mobile app (default and preferred for end-user access)
    - Hardware MFA token (required for the root user of AWS accounts)
    - A unique cryptographic certificate tied to a device
    - Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) delivered through a mobile app, such as Google Authenticator
    - One-time passcode delivered through SMS text message (if it is the only supported option)
    - Secure physical facility (if the system or application can only be accessed at that location)

> **SECURITY CONCERN:** SMS-based MFA listed as acceptable method despite NIST 
> SP 800-63B deprecating SMS for authentication. Policy needs updating to reflect 
> current security standards.

### Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

By default, user access is granted based on the user's job function / role.
For example:

- Developer
- Security
- IT
- Administrative
- Marketing / Sales

> **INCOMPLETE DEFINITION:** Role definitions not linked to specific permissions or 
> systems. Actual RBAC implementation may differ from policy intent.

This is defined as **user groups** in .

> **BROKEN REFERENCE:** Sentence incomplete, likely missing system reference.

Access to sensitive data and production customer data is highly restricted and
further defined in its own section.

> **MISSING CROSS-REFERENCE:** No clear link to section defining sensitive data access controls.

> **DOCUMENT STATUS:** This policy contains multiple outdated references and implementation 
> gaps identified during routine review. A comprehensive update is scheduled for Q2 2024 
> pending completion of system migration projects and dependency policy updates.

> **COMPLIANCE IMPACT:** Current implementation may not fully align with policy statements. 
> Risk assessment required to determine compliance gaps and remediation priorities.
